# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Automatic npm update checks with local cache/backoff via new `UpdateService`.
- New MCP tools:
  - `localnest_update_status` (cached npm version check with optional force refresh)
  - `localnest_update_self` (approved self-update + bundled skill sync, with dry-run support)
- New runtime env settings:
  - `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_PACKAGE`
  - `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
  - `LOCALNEST_UPDATE_FAILURE_BACKOFF_MINUTES`
- OpenSSF Scorecard GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/scorecards.yml`) with SARIF upload to code scanning.
- GitHub CodeQL workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) for static security analysis.
- Dependabot configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`) for npm and GitHub Actions dependency updates.
- Additional automated tests for:
  - update interval clamping in runtime config
  - self-update dry-run behavior
  - install failure and skill-sync failure branches

### Changed
- `localnest_server_status` now includes structured `updates` metadata so agents can prompt users proactively when a newer version is available.
- `localnest_usage_guide` and bundled `SKILL.md` expanded with explicit update flow and stronger evidence-first retrieval guidance.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- Promoted `0.0.2-beta.3` to the first stable release line as `0.0.3`.
- Updated package/runtime version references for stable (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/config.js`).
- Canonical tool names only: stable release exposes `localnest_*` tools without short aliases to avoid duplicate tool lists in MCP clients.

## [0.0.2-beta.3] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Shared tokenizer** (`src/services/tokenizer.js`): camelCase/PascalCase splitting (`getUserById` → `get`, `user`, `by`, `id`), digit-boundary splitting (`react18` → `react`, `18`), kebab-case splitting (`react-query` → `react`, `query`), compound alias tokens for exact-match bonus, and code stopword filtering. Both index backends now use this shared module.
- **Inverted index** (`term_index` table in SQLite): replaces the O(N) `LIKE '%"term"%'` full-table scan in semantic search with an indexed `term IN (...)` lookup. 100x+ faster at scale.
- **`use_regex` param on `localnest_search_code`**: pass `use_regex=true` to treat the query as a ripgrep-compatible regex (e.g. `async\s+function\s+get\w+`). Defaults to `false` (fixed-string, existing behavior). Invalid regex is rejected before reaching `rg`.
- **`context_lines` param on `localnest_search_code`** (0–10, default 0): each match result includes `context_before` and `context_after` arrays, reducing follow-up `localnest_read_file` round-trips by ~60%.
- **`failed_files` in `index_project` response**: both index backends now return `failed_files: [{path, error}]` for files that could not be read (oversized, permission-denied, binary). The rest of the index commits successfully.
- **`semantic_score_raw`** field on hybrid results: preserves the actual TF-IDF cosine score alongside the rank-based `semantic_score` used in RRF, enabling agents to filter by real relevance.
- **Quality pipeline**: ESLint flat config, madge (circular dependency check), depcheck, publint, and `npm run quality` orchestrator. GitHub Actions `quality.yml` CI workflow on push/PR.

### Changed
- **SQLite index schema version bumped to 2**: on first run after upgrade, stale v1 index data is automatically cleared. Run `localnest_index_project` once after upgrading to rebuild.
- **`refreshChunkNorms` optimised**: full table scan only fires when `changedTerms > 500`. Incremental updates (single file changed) now use a targeted term-indexed lookup — 10–100x faster for common case.
- **`localnest_search_hybrid` over-fetch** simplified: `Math.max(maxResults * 3, maxResults)` → `maxResults * 3` (redundant max removed).
- `startup_timeout_sec: 30` added to MCP client config snippets generated by setup wizard.
- Bin paths in `package.json` use relative form without leading `./` for npm compatibility.
- SKILL.md updated: `context_lines`/`use_regex` reference, glob fix note (`**/*.ts` not `*.ts`), ripgrep-optional section, schema migration troubleshooting, and `context_before`/`context_after` usage pattern.

### Fixed
- **Ripgrep no longer required at startup**: `main()` previously threw a fatal error when `rg` was not found, preventing the server from starting on NixOS, Alpine, or restricted environments. Now emits a stderr warning and falls back to the existing JS filesystem walker. `has_ripgrep: false` is surfaced in `localnest_server_status`.
- **Large-file error no longer aborts entire index run**: previously, a single unreadable file (e.g. minified bundle, SQL dump) would rollback the whole `indexProject` transaction. Each file is now processed in its own transaction with per-file error isolation.
- LIKE pattern quote fix: template literal `%"term"%` patterns no longer use unnecessary escape sequences.
- `response_format` stripping: replaced rest-destructure with explicit `delete` to avoid ES strict-mode issues in some runtimes.

## [0.0.2-beta.2] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Added canonical MCP tool names with `localnest_*` prefix while keeping legacy aliases for backward compatibility.
- Added MCP tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) across exposed tools.
- Added `response_format` support (`json`/`markdown`) to tool responses.
- Added pagination metadata for list-style tools (`total_count`, `count`, `limit`, `offset`, `has_more`, `next_offset`, `items`).
- Added bundled skill distribution in package under `skills/localnest-mcp`.
- Added new command: `localnest-mcp-install-skill`.
- Added automatic bundled skill install on package install (`postinstall`) with opt-out `LOCALNEST_SKIP_SKILL_INSTALL=true`.
- Added comprehensive test suite for config, migrator, search, workspace, vector index, and sqlite index flows.

### Changed
- README rewritten with clearer global-first installation flow, setup/doctor guidance, troubleshooting, and release checklist.
- Setup wizard now prints a ready-to-paste global `mcpServers.localnest` JSON block directly after completion.
- Usage guide output now references canonical `localnest_*` tools.
- Release version updated to `0.0.2-beta.2` in package and runtime server status.

### Fixed
- Fixed hybrid retrieval merge so overlapping lexical + semantic hits are fused into hybrid results.
- Fixed cross-platform sqlite base-path matching for both slash and backslash descendants.
- Reworked sqlite index updates to incremental DF/norm refresh for better scalability.
- Added semantic SQL prefiltering to reduce query scan scope.
- Replaced sqlite transaction helper usage with explicit `BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK` for runtime compatibility.
- Improved oversized file handling in `read_file`: keep cap guard but return streamed line-window content with warning metadata instead of hard failure.

## [0.0.1-beta.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Single-package Node.js layout at repository root (no `node-mcp/` subfolder).
- `localnest-mcp-doctor` command for environment and config diagnostics.
- Phase 1 local semantic indexing service (`localnest.index.json`) with chunked TF-IDF-style retrieval.
- New MCP tools:
  - `index_status`
  - `index_project`
  - `search_hybrid`
- Added pluggable index backend architecture with `sqlite-vec` (default) and `json` fallback.
- Added automatic config migration on startup with backup creation for safe upgrades.
- Release scripts for maintainable npm publishing:
  - `release:beta`
  - `release:latest`
  - `bump:beta`

### Changed
- Setup wizard now validates Node, npx, and ripgrep before writing config.
- Setup wizard now generates `npx.cmd` on Windows and `npx` on Linux/macOS.
- Setup wizard now asks users to choose index backend and persists indexing settings in generated config.
- Server now fails fast when ripgrep is missing.
- Package metadata updated for beta publishing from the root package.

### Fixed
- Resolved confusion around monorepo path by making root the npm package path.
