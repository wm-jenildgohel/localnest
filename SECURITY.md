Report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/wm-jenildgohel/localnest/security/advisories/new).

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any suggested fix (optional)

## Scope

LocalNest MCP is a **read-only** local tool — it does not transmit data externally and holds no credentials. The primary attack surface is:

- Path traversal outside configured roots
- Command injection via search parameters passed to ripgrep
- Unsafe handling of untrusted file content during indexing
